Execution of this notebook will create `Combined_Reduced_Trackfile.txt` and `Combined_WWLLN_Locations.txt`, which we will use as our main data source for subsequent analysis. This notebook should be executed after the `data_file_cleaning.ipynb` notebook.\n",

The first half of the code works if the Google Drive API is already set up (refer to instructions in `data_upload.ipynb`). The code after we create the list of files is not dependent on the Google Drive API.\n",
